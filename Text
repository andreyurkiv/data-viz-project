Each year, an estimated 18 billion pounds of plastic waste enters the world’s ocean from coastal regions.[national geographic]

Much of the world’s output of plastic waste comes from China, according to a 2015 report. The nation accounted for about 27.7 percent of the world’s total plastic-waste production, and millions of metric tons ended up as marine debris.[sportdiver]

A garbage patches are massive currents of marine debris that has been drawn together by a circulating ocean gyre. The earth has five major swirling gyres. The majority of the plastic debris ultimately finds its way to one of them. [author]

The plastic is broken down by water and sunlight into small pieces known as microplastic. This poses a threat to marine life. Unable to distinguish microplastics from food, many animals ingest it, causing blockages in their digestive system.[author]

The lagest of the oceanic gyres is the Great Pathific Garbage Patch, in the North Pacific Gyre. It is located roughly from 135°W to 155°W and 35°N to 42°N.The plastic concentration is estimated to be up to 100 kilograms per square kilometer in the center, going down to 10 kilograms per square kilometer in the outer parts of the patch. An estimated 80,000 metric tons of plastic inhabit the patch, totaling 1.8 trillion pieces. [wikipedia]

About 40 percent of all plastic produced is used in packaging, and much of that is used only once and then discarded. Less than a fifth of all plastic is recycled.[national geographic]
